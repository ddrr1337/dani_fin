A python script that calls Oikotie API, saves found apartments on a map, and appends them to a template .xlsx file. These generated files will be found in /generated_files

Note, xlwings requires Excel installation on the computer. I'd rather use openpyxl, but that corrupts the resulting file since it cannot handle the indirect-function and turns them into array formulae. If you find a workaround, let me know.
